# Agile Airplanes

---

## Objective

To demonstrate the power of time-box or Sprint that makes the heartbeat of an agile framework like Scrum.

---

## Overview

**Team Based Activity**

> How many can you build in three minutes?

**Time Needed:** 45 minutes

**Maximum # of people per team:** 6

* Supplies Needed:
  * Used Printer Paper 50 per team
  * Something to keep score
  
---

## Goals

The goal of the game is for each team to create as much high quality tested planes that can fly a distance across the room.

---

## Stages of Play

* Each iteration last 9 minutes.
  * **3 minutes** for planning,
  * **3 minutes** of actual build ( test included) time,
  * **3 minutes** for review/retrospective

---

## Rules

* Build as many paper planes as you can in a 3-minute time box.
* _One player_ can only do one fold at a time. That rules stays true for all three time-boxes.
* The planes should be built and tested in the 3-minute increment
* Only planes that cross the distance will be counted
* Each team should give a count of how many planes they are going to build before the time-box starts.
* Subtract the final count of planes that actually flew from the planes that were built but were not tested or completed.
  * Eg: Team A said they will make 4 planes, 7 planes flew all the way but 5 were WIP ( work in progress). Subtract WIP so the actual is 7-5 =2
* The team has to come up with one idea of improvement at the retrospective.
* Have one member in the team be the counter.
* The front of the plane should be blunt to avoid injury to the team members.
* You cannot crush the plane into a ball and throw.
