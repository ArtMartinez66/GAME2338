# 1970s
      
* Games has not ROM just switchs to tell CPU what game to play
* The person/develoepr who developed the game tested their game on their own time
* No real testing team
* In 1974, an Altair 8880 with 4 KB RAM cost $338

# 1980s
      
* in early 80s, games were the next big thing, games were growing at a rate of 50% per year
 * Low quality, bad products
 * Sales and stock prices dwindled
 * Period called 'Video Game Crash of 1983'
* Teams of zero testers evolved into 3 person teams

# 2010s

* More processing doesn't solve the problems and limits of the systems
* Larger games means more testing
* Focus on copying features and functionality
