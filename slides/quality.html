* ISO 8402-1986 standard defines quality as "the totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bears its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs."

# Definitions

* “Software quality assurance (SQA) is a process that ensures that developed software meets and complies with defined or standardized quality specifications. SQA is an ongoing process within the software development life cycle (SDLC) that routinely checks the developed software to ensure it meets desired quality measures.”

---
      
# Defintions

* **Quality Assurance** is “a planned and systematic set of activities to provide adequate confidence that product/service will conform to specified requirements and meet user needs” (_Preventive_)
* **Quality Control** is “the process by which product quality is compared with applicable standards, and the action taken when nonconformance is detected.” (_Detective_)

# What is Quality All About?

* Quality is more than just zero defects, it is about meeting the customer’s need or specified requirements.

# Perspective of Quality
      
## Five Perspectives of Quality
      
* Transcendent
 * Looks right when you see it
* Product-Based
 * Has Desired Features
* User-Based
 * Fit for use
* Development & Manufacturing Based
 * Conforms to requirements or standards
* Value-Based
 * Acceptable cost, within budget

---

# Cost of Quality

* Money spent during project avoid failures
* Money spent during and after project because of failures/defects

* Types of Costs
 * Prevention
  - Training, Documentation, Equipment, Time
 * Appraisal
  - Testing, inspections, reviews
 * Failure
  - Rework, repairing defect after product is delivered

# Software Quality Factors
      
* Applying quality factors improves the quality of the product by having a focused testing strategy
* Certified Software Tester (CSTE) Common Book of Knowledge describes 11 quality factors

# Software Quality Factors
      
* Correctness – satisfies requirements
      
* Reliability – performs intended function consistently
      
* Efficiency – amount of computing resources or code
      
* Integrity – controlled access to the software
      
* Usability – effort required to learn software
      
* Maintainability – locating and fixing errors
      
* Testability – effort required to test
      
* Flexibility – effort required modifying operational program
      
* Portability – effort required to transfer from one configuration to the next
      
* Reusability – program can be used in other applications
      
* Interoperability – effort to couple one system with another

# What you might test?
      
* Games – PC/Console
* Web-based applications
* Standalone/Legacy applications
* Web Services
* Mobile devices
* Database/Data Quality
