# Test Cases / Script
---
# Test Case
* A test case is a step by step, set of inputs or execution conditions and expected results developed to fulfill a test objective or requirement.
* A test case is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly.

# Why write test cases?
* To find defects
* To assess quality
* To validate requirements
---
# Benefits of Test Cases
* Repeatable
 * Each tester will follow the same script and get the same results, making it easier to identify defects
* Training
 * New tester will run test cases to learn the application
---
# Building Test Cases
* Ensure you understand the software/game design
* Identify test objectives
* Identify pre-test conditions
 * Test Data
 * Test Environment
* Identify expected results
* Identify specific step to be performed
---
# Test Case Guidelines
* Write test cases before implementation or first test cycle
* Use the same format for all tests
* Test cases should be understandable and easy to follow
---
# Test Coverage
* Make sure your test cases have covered the design and/or requirements
* Test Tools can assist analyzing test coverage against requirements
